lately i've been working with a patch in a small modular case. the results have been  varied, but ultimately good.

I recently revisited the use of the piezothings with the old zither with great results.
I might have to bring this gear along on the eastern campaign(a gig in brandon mb in september, yorkton sk in october, and guelph on in november)</p>
